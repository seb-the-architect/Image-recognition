# Image-recognition
A discord bot built on NodeJS that recognises images of pokemon via web scraping. Captures pokemon :)

This solution recognises messages sent by the pokemon bot in a discord server. Images of pokemon are recognised via web scraping and then caught.

Check out image.png for what it looks like.
